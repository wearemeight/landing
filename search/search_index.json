Meight\u2019s technology rests on the use of data to generate foresight, maximizing efficiency and safety through optimal driving behaviour. This positive effect is achieved by real-time wielding of considerable amounts of driving and location data of different drivers and trucks. Said information could, in theory, be used for other purposes, such as active surveillance or employee performance monitoring. Or even more less obvious results, such as driver profiling on the basis of their personal information. Our technology does nothing of the sort and Meight takes ethical personal data treatment very seriously. Any and all monitoring of driving behaviour is done automatically, without real-time human intervention The loop of data between the vehicle device, our servers and the driver is completely closed. Any personal data that might be collected is processed in a fully GDPR compliant way, only for the purpose of calculating outputs that positively influence efficiency and, more importantly, are stored and treated in a completely anonymous way. Moreover, all interactions and use of analytical tools with our database are logged and monitored to ensure that no undue access occurs. We aim to ensure that we respect the persons behind the data, achieving an improvement in their day-to-day work. Information that is collected from our customers for commercial contacts \u00b6 Name, website, VAT number, name of the business contact person, email, telephone number. Other information that we collect \u00b6 Meight collects and treats the following information (if applicable): Accounts and billing \u00b6 Name, address and postal code, telephone number, birth date, VAT number, civil identification number and email address, of the Client and representatives; Whenever the identity of the representatives must be checked (for example, to sign an agreement or to exercise access rights), we might ask to be shown the identification documents or, if more convenient, copies of these documents might be requested, which will be archived; Information related to the bank account information and other banking information, for example for the payment of services; Information related to the account, including subscribed products and services, account receivables and paid amounts; Contacts with representatives for customer support through email or any other means with Meight; Log-in information, for account and service usage authentication and access. Network data \u00b6 Information collected by Meight devices and generated by the use of our services and products, such as location data, usage data and driving information. How we use that information \u00b6 We will process personal data, as necessary, for concluding agreements and following-up on Client requests. Personal data may also be used when there is a legitimate interest to do so, to fulfil a legal obligation that Meight is bound to or when Client or the service Users give consent, whenever treatment cannot be justified on other legal reasons. This information is mandatory and will be used only for billing, customer support and Meight technology optimization. Meight may use information listed in i., namely for providing services, billing and collection of payment for rendered services, for customer support, for personalized service, complaint and claim settlement and also to give answers to requests. So that we can evaluate your degree of satisfaction with the services, Meight may request that you answer questionnaires or participate in surveys. From the information listed in ii., Meight\u2019s technology automatically creates reports and datasets with aggregated and statistical information which does not individually identify any user, anonymizing said information for a more detailed analysis towards technology optimization. Also from the information listed in ii., Meight\u2019s technology automatically creates ratings applicable to portions of predetermined driving journeys, which then can automatically be met with corresponding anonymized Driver IDs, with Meight not having access to any location or usage data of the products and services that can be made independent as relating to a certain User. This treatment helps Meight improve the services being provided without users being identified in an individual manner. The treatment of said data for these analyses does not allow that Users are retroactively identified, in any way. To insure the safety and improvement of products and services, Meight has the right to monitor performance of the services being provided and their quality, allowing for the identification of any technical failures, transmission errors, virus, IT piracy and other menaces or cybersecurity vulnerabilities, no exercising, in any way, through human means, any control over the content of the information being transmitted through the network. We also reserve the right to analyse how our services and products are being used, so that we can review, develop and improve them, as well as develop products and services more interesting and tailored towards the Clients. Finally, we reserve the right to research and create analytical information, using a variety of analytical methods (\u201cBig data analytics\u201d), using mathematical techniques that study big datasets to find patterns and bias. These analyses are treated seriously, and the databases used by Meight\u2019s employees do not include any type of personal data, being automatically generated in anonymized form and without back references by Meight\u2019s technology. Meight uses this analytical information for market studies and to develop research and statistical analysis, including ways of optimizing driving. How long do we keep your data \u00b6 Account information of clients is kept for the amount of time determined by law or the amount of time necessary for providing the service. When the contract ends, Meight may keep the data for a period of ten years, in order to adequately fulfil legal obligations, namely for auditing and tax purposes.

Licensee acknowledges and agrees that each Licensor affiliated company shall be a third party beneficiary to the License Agreement and shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License Agreement which confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Subject to the foregoing, no other person shall be a third party beneficiary to the License Agreement. For the purposes of the License Agreement, an affiliated company of Licensor is any company, corporation, firm, partnership or other entity that is controlled by the Licensor or is under common control with the Licensor; the term \"controls\" and \"controlled\" meaning the ability to direct the management of the relevant entity. Licensee may not transfer, assign, charge or otherwise dispose of the License Agreement or any of the rights or obligations arising under it, without the Licensor\u2019s prior written consent. The Licensor will not refuse to give consent without good reason. The Licensor will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any of its obligations under this License Agreement that is caused by events outside the Licensor\u2019s reasonable control (\"Force Majeure Event\"). A Force Majeure Event includes any act, event, non-happening, omission or accident beyond reasonable control and includes in particular (without limitation) strikes, lock-outs or other industrial action, civil commotion, riot, invasion, terrorist attack or threat of terrorist attack, war (whether declared or not) or threat or preparation for war, fire, explosion, storm, flood, earthquake, subsidence, epidemic or other natural disaster, impossibility of the use of railways, shipping, aircraft, motor transport or other means of public or private transport, impossibility of the use of public or private telecommunications networks, the acts, decrees, legislation, regulations or restrictions of any government. The Licensor\u2019s performance under the License Agreement is deemed to be suspended for the period that the Force Majeure Event continues, and the time of performance will be extended for the duration of that period. We will use our reasonable endeavors to bring the Force Majeure Event to a close or to find a solution by which our obligations under the License Agreement may be performed despite the Force Majeure Event. Governing Law and Jurisdiction This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the Laws of Portugal, and the Parties irrevocably submit and attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of \u00c9vora, Portugal with respect to any matter arising under or related to any Agreement. Despite the foregoing, (a) each party may seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction; and (b) the parties hereby exclude the application of the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.","title":"END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT"}]}
