    All communications to be made between the Parties concerning this Agreement shall be deemed to have been properly served if sent by e-mail, registered mail with return receipt or hand delivered with a delivery receipt to Licensor corporate headquarters.

1. **General**
    
    Licensor intends to rely upon only the written terms set out in this License Agreement and not any representations made elsewhere, directly to you by any of the Licensor employees. Licensee must read the terms carefully and should contact the Licensor and must not use the Software if the terms include things that the Licensee does not wish to agree to. In that way any confusion about what Licensee and Licensor are expected to do can be avoided.
    
    Licensee agrees that if Licensor does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is set out in this or other agreement, or which Licensor has the benefit of under any applicable law, this will not be construed as a formal waiver of Licensor’s rights or remedies and that such rights or remedies remain available to the Licensor.
    
    If any provision of this License Agreement is invalid, as determined by a court of law having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, then that provision will be removed from the License Agreement without affecting the remaining provisions of the License Agreement, which will continue to be valid and enforceable.
    
    Licensee acknowledges and agrees that each Licensor affiliated company shall be a third party beneficiary to the License Agreement and shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License Agreement which confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Subject to the foregoing, no other person shall be a third party beneficiary to the License Agreement. For the purposes of the License Agreement, an affiliated company of Licensor is any company, corporation, firm, partnership or other entity that is controlled by the Licensor or is under common control with the Licensor; the term "controls" and "controlled" meaning the ability to direct the management of the relevant entity.
    
    Licensee may not transfer, assign, charge or otherwise dispose of the License Agreement or any of the rights or obligations arising under it, without the Licensor’s prior written consent. The Licensor will not refuse to give consent without good reason.
The Licensor will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any of its obligations under this License Agreement that is caused by events outside the Licensor’s reasonable control ("Force Majeure Event"). A Force Majeure Event includes any act, event, non-happening, omission or accident beyond reasonable control and includes in particular (without limitation) strikes, lock-outs or other industrial action, civil commotion, riot, invasion, terrorist attack or threat of terrorist attack, war (whether declared or not) or threat or preparation for war, fire, explosion, storm, flood, earthquake, subsidence, epidemic or other natural disaster, impossibility of the use of railways, shipping, aircraft, motor transport or other means of public or private transport, impossibility of the use of public or private telecommunications networks, the acts, decrees, legislation, regulations or restrictions of any government. The Licensor’s performance under the License Agreement is deemed to be suspended for the period that the Force Majeure Event continues, and the time of performance will be extended for the duration of that period. We will use our reasonable endeavors to bring the Force Majeure Event to a close or to find a solution by which our obligations under the License Agreement may be performed despite the Force Majeure Event.

1. **Governing Law and Jurisdiction**
    
    This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the Laws of Portugal, and the Parties irrevocably submit and attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Évora, Portugal with respect to any matter arising under or related to any Agreement.  Despite the foregoing, (a) each party may seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction; and (b) the parties hereby exclude the application of the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.
