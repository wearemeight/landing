Meight reserves the right to resort to third party contractors to provide full or partial treatment of the personal data collected under the contract, as allowed for by Law. These entities will be bound by the same rules as those determined in this agreement, and will keep secrecy and ensure safety of the data that they might have access to, being obligated not to use that data in any way or for any other means, nor connecting that data with any other data that they have. In the case Meight were to send data to a country that is not part of the European Union, enforcement of all locally applicable legal rules will be ensured and also that those transfers will occur under model provisions approved by the European Commission for this purpose, in the case the destination state does not possess legislation deemed equivalent to the European one in the matters of personal data.

Meight might also use personal data to comply with legal obligations or requests from authorities (i.e., courts, police, regulatory authorities), or to, in Meightâ€™s legitimate interest, to further claims or complaints concerning its rights or to protect Clients. Personal data of Clients will only be made available when Meight is bound to do so by law and after an exhaustive analysis of legal requirements.
