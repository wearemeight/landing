<h2 id="license-agreement">License agreement<a class="headerlink" href="#license-agreement" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The use of Meight Technologies, S.A.’s (“Meight”) products and services is governed by the General Agreement and the following terms and conditions, which, with other terms contained in web links listed below, are an agreement between you and Meight. You should review this entire non-exclusive License, including any linked terms, because all the terms are important and create this agreement that applies to you.  You can review linked terms by pasting the applicable link into your browser window.</p>
<h4 id="i-terms">I. Terms.<a class="headerlink" href="#i-terms" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p><strong>By using the products and services, you agree to all these terms and consent to the transmission of certain information during your use of the software pursuant to the Privacy Statement linked below in this Supplement. If you do not accept and comply with these terms, you may not use the services, software or their features.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use Rights:</strong> The software is licensed, not sold. Your non-exclusive right to use the service/software is determined in the General Agreement, which may be extended. The use of Meight products and services is only admissible while the General Agreement is in force, solely by use of the devices which were made available to you by Meight. This Use Right expressly excludes any assignment of the rights granted to a third party, at any title. </li>
<li><strong>Reservation of Rights and Feedback:</strong> All Intellectual Property Rights contained or implied by the products and services are owned solely by Meight and are not being licensed as an effect of this license agreement for the use of Meight’s products and services. Except as expressly provided, Meight does not grant you a license or any other rights of any type under any patents, know-how, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks or other intellectual property owned or controlled by Meight or any related entity, including but not limited to any name, trade dress, logo or equivalents. If you give to Meight any idea, proposal, suggestion or feedback, including without limitation ideas for new products, technologies, promotions, product names, product feedback and product improvements (“Feedback”), you give to Meight, without charge, royalties or other obligation to you, the right to make, have made, create derivative works, use, share and commercialize your Feedback in any way and for any purpose. </li>
<li><strong>Using the products and services:</strong> To protect your account, keep your account details and password confidential. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account log-in information.  When there’s something we need to tell you about our products and services, we might send you notifications through the dashboard. Customer support is available, send us an email if you have doubts. If your General Agreement is cancelled (whether by you or us), your right to access the products and services stops immediately and your license ends. As a result you may no longer be able to access any of the products or services. </li>
<li><strong>Service Availability:</strong>  The products and services may be unavailable from time to time, may be offered for a limited time, or may vary depending on region. We strive to keep them up and running; however, all online services suffer occasional disruptions and outages, and Meight is not liable for any disruption or loss you may suffer as a result. </li>
<li><strong>Updates to the products and services and changes to these terms:</strong> We may change these terms at any time, and we’ll tell you when we do. </li>

<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<p>Licensor intends to rely upon only the written terms set out in this License Agreement and not any representations made elsewhere, directly to you by any of the Licensor employees. Licensee must read the terms carefully and should contact the Licensor and must not use the Software if the terms include things that the Licensee does not wish to agree to. In that way any confusion about what Licensee and Licensor are expected to do can be avoided.</p>
<p>Licensee agrees that if Licensor does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is set out in this or other agreement, or which Licensor has the benefit of under any applicable law, this will not be construed as a formal waiver of Licensor’s rights or remedies and that such rights or remedies remain available to the Licensor.</p>
<p>If any provision of this License Agreement is invalid, as determined by a court of law having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, then that provision will be removed from the License Agreement without affecting the remaining provisions of the License Agreement, which will continue to be valid and enforceable.</p>
<p>Licensee acknowledges and agrees that each Licensor affiliated company shall be a third party beneficiary to the License Agreement and shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License Agreement which confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Subject to the foregoing, no other person shall be a third party beneficiary to the License Agreement. For the purposes of the License Agreement, an affiliated company of Licensor is any company, corporation, firm, partnership or other entity that is controlled by the Licensor or is under common control with the Licensor; the term "controls" and "controlled" meaning the ability to direct the management of the relevant entity.</p>
<p>Licensee may not transfer, assign, charge or otherwise dispose of the License Agreement or any of the rights or obligations arising under it, without the Licensor’s prior written consent. The Licensor will not refuse to give consent without good reason.
The Licensor will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any of its obligations under this License Agreement that is caused by events outside the Licensor’s reasonable control ("Force Majeure Event"). A Force Majeure Event includes any act, event, non-happening, omission or accident beyond reasonable control and includes in particular (without limitation) strikes, lock-outs or other industrial action, civil commotion, riot, invasion, terrorist attack or threat of terrorist attack, war (whether declared or not) or threat or preparation for war, fire, explosion, storm, flood, earthquake, subsidence, epidemic or other natural disaster, impossibility of the use of railways, shipping, aircraft, motor transport or other means of public or private transport, impossibility of the use of public or private telecommunications networks, the acts, decrees, legislation, regulations or restrictions of any government. The Licensor’s performance under the License Agreement is deemed to be suspended for the period that the Force Majeure Event continues, and the time of performance will be extended for the duration of that period. We will use our reasonable endeavors to bring the Force Majeure Event to a close or to find a solution by which our obligations under the License Agreement may be performed despite the Force Majeure Event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</strong></p>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the Laws of Portugal, and the Parties irrevocably submit and attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Évora, Portugal with respect to any matter arising under or related to any Agreement.  Despite the foregoing, (a) each party may seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction; and (b) the parties hereby exclude the application of the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods. </p>
